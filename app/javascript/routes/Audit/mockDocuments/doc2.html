<b>Compliance Review EXPECTATIONS</b>
<br/>
<br/>
General Compliance
<br/>
We have reviewed your practices and procedures to ensure that you are compliant in the specific areas of stationery, signage, promotional materials, registers, complaints handling, filing systems and privacy policies. We also tested your knowledge and understanding of various policies such as the No Advice procedures, and Disaster Recovery systems.
Our Representative Manual (Policy and Procedures) sets out our requirements in detail and you should be familiar with its requirements.
<br/><br/>
Data Collection
<br/>
We expect to see a fully completed Data Collection Form (DCF) in all clients’ files. The DCFs must be signed by both the Representative and the client(s), and must contain comprehensive risk profiling when required and a signed Privacy Consent form in all cases.
Terms of Engagement
<br/>
We expect you to use the current version of Madison’s preferred software in developing comprehensive detailed Statements of Advice (SoAs). All recommendations must be provided within a SoA.  Risk profiling is an essential component of all investment advice.  The SoA should contain a strong discussion of risk profiling that clearly nominates a profile type, and a recommended asset allocation that is consistent with the client(s) profile when providing investment product advice.
<br/><br/>
Disclosure
<br/>
We expect all Advice to contain the full version of Madison’s standard disclosure wording in all cases. The standard wordings for disclosure are maintained in the current version of Madison’s templates. It is crucial to ensure that the current version is used in all SoA.  All interests in recommended securities and relevant incentives including soft dollar and referral fees must be disclosed to the client(s).  Ensure you have all Conflicts of Interest that could affect your advice have been documented within the SoA.  All costs to the client(s) including Adviser Service Fees, Fee for Service, initial and trail commissions must be disclosed in both dollar and percentage terms.
<br/><br/>
Implementation
<br/>
Madison requires that all clients’ files should contain a signed and dated Authority to Proceed (ATP) form, copies of all completed application forms and copies of cheques or switching forms.  The original ATP form should be handed to the client(s) to keep and a copy is to be filed in the client’s file.  Where the client(s) wishes to vary your advice, you need to document the variation. Where the variation is minor, only the ATP form needs to be amended to reflect the client’s wishes.  However, if the variation is significant between your recommendation and the client’s proposal, a new SoA including current fee disclosure may need to be completed.  In both cases, an elaborate file note on the matter needs to be prepared by the Representative and filed in the client’s file.
<br/>
File Records
<br/><br/>
We reviewed the standard of your clients’ files.  The Representative Manual provides an example of what a standard client file should look like.  However, Madison does recognises that each practice has their individual file style.  Even if the layout might vary between practices, Madison expects there to be certain requirements such as file notes, copy of all correspondence and be able to easily locate certain documents in every client file.

<br/>
Compliance Rating:	‘Non-Compliant’
<br/>
Auditor Comment:
It was noted that Adviser 1 currently maintains his client files across Xplan, his own server and Outlook. Some documents are also retained in a hard copy file. The benefits of ensuring that all documents are saved/held in the one secure location were discussed with Adviser 1 during the audit debrief.
The requirement to retain a PDF or hard copy version of all advice documents and Fact Finds (FFs) completed by the clients was also discussed with Adviser 1. It was noted that some SoAs and FFs reviewed had been saved as ‘Word’ documents only.
In some instances, errors had been corrected on client forms using ‘liquid paper’. It is strongly advised that ‘liquid paper’ is not used on any form that is signed by the client due to the potential for unauthorised activity to occur.
Adviser 1 must ensure that where sections of the FF are incomplete, they are crossed-out and marked as ‘not applicable’ or ‘not disclosed’ as appropriate.

All files
Although a Finametrica had been completed for all client files, no ‘supplementary risk profile form’ had been completed.
For clients Client 1, there were no notes in the file demonstrating how the agreed risk profile for the clients’ joint investment plan had been determined. It was noted that the Finametrica scores for each of the clients were different.
Completion of the additional form assists in demonstrating the process through which the client’s risk profile was determined.
The client file must demonstrate the process through which the agreed risk profile was determined. Where the Finametrica outcome does not match the agreed risk profile, the reasons for selecting the agreed risk profile must be recorded in a file note.
Licensee Requirement
Going forward, Adviser 1 should complete the ‘supplementary risk profile form’ in order to ensure that the client has signed off on their agreed risk profile.
For clients Client 1, Adviser 1 must detail the reasons for the clients’ agreed joint risk profile in a file note.
Ongoing
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

<br/>

The SoAs recommended that the client salary sacrifice into superannuation in order to offset the cost of insurance premiums being drawn from the funds.
However, the salary sacrifice amounts recommended were equal to the insurance premiums and did not take into account taxation considerations. The recommended salary sacrifice amounts would therefore not cover the cost of insurance premiums deducted from the funds.
Adviser 1 acknowledged the issue.
Care should be taken to ensure that all relevant considerations are taken into account in determining the salary sacrifice amount.
Legal Requirement
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

The salary sacrifice arrangements must be reviewed and further advice provided where required in order to ensure that the arrangements remain appropriate.
9 February 2018
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

Client 3
The following issues were noted with regards to the FDS:
The fee period was stated as 14 July 2016 to 14 July 2017. The fee period must be 12 months. That is, 14 July 2016 to 13 July 2017.
The FDS included services that were provided by the product provider rather than the adviser. For example, ‘online account access’.
Some of the services listed were irrelevant and should not have been included as an ‘available service’. For example, ‘document depository’.
Adviser 1 acknowledged the above issues.
The FDS must correctly disclose the services that the client was entitled to receive under the ongoing fee arrangement.
Legal Requirement
Adviser 1 must address the noted issues and reissue the FDS to the client.
9 February 2018
Ensure that the updated FDS has been provided.
<br/>

Client 1
For clients, AIA insurance cover had been implemented and a Madison ‘No Advice’ form had been completed and retained on file. However, an ‘insurance needs analysis’ had been undertaken and the client file evidenced that personal advice had been provided.
Adviser 1 acknowledged the issue and agreed that a SoA should have been completed for the clients in this instance.
All personal advice must be documented in a SoA.
Legal Requirement
Adviser 1 must review the client’s insurance needs and document the advice provided in a SoA.
Immediately
Ensure the adviser completes the required SoA.
<br/>

Client 1
Client 4
<br/>

The scope of advice to be provided by Adviser 1 had not been clearly documented in either the files or the SoAs. That is, the investment goals stated in each of the SoAs were not addressed by the subsequent recommendations.  Adviser 1 stated that for each client the agreed scope of advice was to provide investment recommendations in line with their agreed risk profile. He further stated that he had included modelling in the SoAs in order to demonstrate the estimated time it would take to reach the stated client goals based on their agreed risk profiles and ongoing contributions.
The subject matter and scope of advice must be clearly documented in the SoA.
Legal Requirement
For each of the noted clients, Adviser 1 must detail conversations held with regards to the client goals and the agreed scope of advice in a file note.
9 February 2018
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

Client 1
<br/>

The Authority to Proceed (ATP) was unable to be located.
Adviser 1 stated that he had obtained the signed ATPs but acknowledged that they had not been retained on file.
A signed and dated ATP confirms that the client understood and accepted the recommendations prior to implementation.
Licensee Requirement
Adviser 1 must locate the signed ATPs and place them on each of the client files. Where the ATP is unable to be located, a file note should be added to the file confirming the same.
9 February 2018
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

<br/>

The electronic FF had been completed, but the relevant ‘authorisation and declaration’ pages had not been signed and dated by the clients.
Furthermore, as the Terms of Engagement (ToE) had not been signed, there was no signed TFN authority on file.
The FF is the adviser’s primary data collection tool and must be signed by the client.
Where a client’s TFN is retained, it is a legal requirement that an appropriate TFN authority signed by the client must be retained on the file.
Licensee Requirement & Legal Requirement
Going forward, Adviser 1 must ensure that the clients sign and date the FF.
The TFN’s retained on file must be immediately destroyed.
Ongoing & Immediately
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

<br/>

It was not clear from the SoA or file notes whether the ongoing investment amount had been directed by the client or whether this was a recommendation by the adviser.
Adviser 1 stated that the $5000 ongoing investment had been directed by the client based on affordability.
Any client instruction affecting the scope of advice provided must be documented in the SoA and should reconcile with the relevant file notes retained in the file.
Licensee Requirement
Going forward, Adviser 1 must ensure that any client instructions are clearly stated both in the SoA and in the relevant file note.
Ongoing
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

<br/>

The following errors were noted in the SoA:
The surplus income was noted as $120, 000. However, this did not take into account any tax payable.
The SoA incorrectly stated that the clients were to retain $30, 000 in cash. The correct amount was $20, 000.
<br/>
The SoA should be thoroughly reviewed prior to presentation in order to identify and correct any content errors.
Industry Best Practice
Going forward, Adviser 1 must ensure that all advice documents are thoroughly reviewed prior to presentation in order to identify and correct any content errors.
Ongoing
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

Client 4
A FF or completed risk profiling tool was unable to be located.
The client’s risk profile as stated in the SoA was therefore unable to be confirmed.
The FF and an approved risk profiling tool are the adviser’s primary data collection tools and assist in demonstrating that the adviser has conducted reasonable enquiries into the client’s circumstances in order to provide the recommendations.
Licensee Requirement
Adviser 1 must ensure that a FF and an approved risk profiling tool are completed at the client’s next review.
A file note must be added to the file detailing the client’s reasons for seeking further advice and also how the risk profile as stated in the SoA was determined.
At next review & 9 February 2018
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

Client 4
The SoA recommended that the client retain and make no changes to their personal insurance held with AIA. However, there were no notes in the file recording any discussions with the client as to whether the levels of cover remained appropriate.
Adviser 1 stated that he had reviewed and discussed the client’s insurance needs, but acknowledged that this had not been recorded in a file note.
All client meetings and reviews must be appropriately recorded in a file note. This assists in demonstrating that the adviser has conducted a reasonable investigation into the client’s circumstances in order to ensure that the advice remains appropriate.
Industry Best Practice
Adviser 1 must detail discussions held with the client regarding their insurance needs in a file note.
9 February 2018
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

Client 4
A copy of the FDS was unable to be located.
Adviser 1 stated that the FDS was provided to the client, but acknowledged that a copy was unable to be located.
A copy of the FDS issued to the client must be retained in the file.
Licensee Requirement
Going forward, Adviser 1 must ensure that a copy of the FDS is retained in the file.
Ongoing
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

Client 1
<br/>

The SoA recommended that both clients replace their existing super funds in order to meet their goal of reducing fees. However, the product replacement information included in the SoA showed that the recommended fund was in fact more expensive.
Adviser 1 stated that the product fees as stated in the SoA were incorrect and the ongoing product fees were lower in the recommended product.
The SoA must clearly demonstrate how replacing the existing product is in the client’s best interests.
Furthermore, the SoA must include sufficient information to allow the client to make an informed decision as to whether they should proceed with the recommendation.
Legal Requirement
Adviser 1 must provide a letter to the client, which includes an updated ‘product replacement table’.
9 February 2018
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

Client 1
<br/>

For clients Client 1 and Nguyen all variances between the proposed and target asset allocation for the clients’ risk profile had not been explained in the relevant section of the advice document.
Where the proposed asset allocation varies from the target asset allocation by 10% or more, the reasons for the variance must be detailed in the relevant section of the advice document. This applies to the individual asset classes as well as the broader growth and defensive split.
Licensee Requirement
Adviser 1 must detail the reasons for the variances in a file note.
9 February 2018
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

All files
Where it is determined through the fact-finding process that the client has not recently reviewed their estate planning requirements, the SoA should include a statement recommending that the client seeks advice from an estate planning professional.
It is considered ‘best practice’ to include a recommendation in the SoA to an estate planning specialist such as a solicitor where it is known that the client has not recently reveiwed their estate planning needs.
Industry Best Practice
Going forward, where it is determined through the fact-finding process that the client has not recently reviewed their estate planning requirements, the SoA should include a statement recommending that the client seeks advice from an estate planning professional.
Ongoing
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
<br/>

All files
There was no evidence on any of the client files reviewed that alternate products or strategies had been considered as part of forming the recommendations.
Adviser 1 stated that alternate products and strategies are always considered as part of his standard business process. He acknowledged that they had not been recorded in the client files.
As part of meeting ‘best interests duty’ the client file must demonstrate that the adviser has considered alternate products and strategies in forming the recommendations.
Legal Requirement
Going forward, Adviser 1 must ensure that evidence is retained in the client file of all alternate products and strategies considered.
Ongoing
Ensure that the adviser understands the requirement.
