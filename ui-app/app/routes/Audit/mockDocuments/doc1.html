<ol>
    <li>I recommend you seek the assistance of Peter Fawcett and Ritchie Cruz of Agera Advisors and a property lawyer – Rahul at Marsdens Law regarding the property purchase issue.</li>

    <li>
        I recommend you seek legal advice from Perkins Fahey lawyers to get your will and estate plan in order.
    </li>

    <li>
    I recommend you commence a savings plan by initially contributing $5,000 and then adding $2,000 per month. We recommend the investment is owned in your own name and you arrange to have investment income reinvested.
    </li>

    <li>
    I recommend that you apply for personal insurance as follows:
    To protect you and your family in the event that you are unable to work again due to permanent disability, we recommend a Superlink Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) insurance of $817,000.
    To reduce the financial risk that can result from a major illness, we recommend Trauma insurance of $448,000. We recommend you own the cover in your own name.



    To provide you with an ongoing income if you are unable to work due to illness or injury, we recommend income protection insurance to pay a benefit of $4,812 per month, to be owned via superannuation.


    This policy should be selected with the following features:
    waiting period of 30 days
    benefits paid for 2 years
    </li>

<b>Why this is appropriate</b>

        Below we have summarised the benefits of our recommendations and how they place you in a better financial position:
    <li>
    You would like to discuss your position in the property purchase with your partner and your partner’s family. I informed you that because I have no information regarding your partner’s family position, I can’t provide a full recommendation financially – as there are no documents on record regarding property purchase confirmation and pricing. I did refer you to a property lawyer and accountant to confirm your position around the purchase of the property.
    </li>
    <li>
    You would like me to refer you to a lawyer for advice on estate planning.
    </li>
    <li>
    You have stated that you would like to start a savings plan for ulClient 1ately an investment property should this current property purchase failing to go through. You would also like to build on your assets at this stage – you have limited assets in your personal name and thus I have recommended that you set aside cash from every pay cycle to build on an investment portfolio.
    </li>
    <li>
    You have current insurance cover with OnePath. You had requested for a review of your insurance cover to ensure that it is still relevant and that the premiums are not too much.

    You have requested that I review your current superannuation holdings and recommend a cheaper alternative for you at this stage.
